## Technical Implementation Notes

### **Current Architecture Strengths:**
- Excellent building classification (67 types)
- Comprehensive road system (26 types)
- Strong accessibility feature support
- Proper geometry handling (Points, LineStrings, Polygons)
- Clean SVG output with ARIA labels

### **Implementation Requirements:**
1. **Overpass API Queries** - Add new queries for each feature category
2. **Feature Styling** - Define colors, sizes, symbols for each feature type
3. **SVG Rendering** - Implement point, line, and polygon rendering
4. **Accessibility** - Ensure ARIA labels and screen reader compatibility
5. **Performance** - Consider tile size impact with dense feature sets

### **Missing Technical Components:**
1. **RegionManager** - Referenced but not implemented
2. **Database Integration** - Tile metadata storage is stubbed
3. **Error Recovery** - Limited error handling in feature processing
4. **Icon System** - No symbol/icon rendering for point features

### **Recommendation:**
Focus on Phase 1 features first, as these provide the most value for accessibility and practical navigation. The current system architecture is solid and can easily accommodate these additions through the existing feature processing pipeline.

- **Landuse** - No zoning information (residential, commercial areas)

### **Recommendation for Canadian Field Testing:**
Our current implementation covers **50% of OSM categories comprehensively** (up from 46%). With comprehensive Automotive Services now implemented alongside all other Phase 1 priorities (Shopping & Retail, Financial Services, Food & Sustenance, Healthcare, Transit, Water features, Emergency Services, Public Facilities, Tourism, and Entertainment & Culture), we now have outstanding coverage of essential urban navigation needs including complete vehicle and transportation services.

**The 14 remaining completely missing categories still represent opportunities to enhance the navigation system's utility for accessibility users. The system now provides comprehensive coverage of most daily navigation needs for Canadian urban environments, with Transportation Infrastructure, Natural Features, and Office services being the next logical priorities for specialized use cases.**
